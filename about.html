      		<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
     		<p>In making our project, we utlized p5 speech recognition, Google Firebase as a database to store
     		users and their corresponding pet, and Bootstrap to make our site look fabulous!</p>
      		<p>The speech recognition was used as a way to make your pet feel more real; try saying "hi" or "hello" out loud to your pet!</p>
      		<p>As for Firebase, we decided that it was one of the best ways, for our purposes, to store the properties of a user's pet and load them
      			into the game.  But of course, with loading a pet, means that one must save a pet.  The game autosaves every minute when the pet's age updates, and
      		if the user needs to log out before then, there's a handy save button right on the main menu that looks like a floppy disk.</p>
   		</div>
    	<div class="col-sm-4">
      		<h3>Features</h3>
     		  <p>This little pet packs a hefty amount of features considering the time frame we had for this project!</p>
     		  <p>The pet, using the setInterval() function, has functions that automatically are called at specific time
     		  intervals to make the pet get hungry, sad, and sick in real time!  The pet will also, when a user logs out and logs back in later, continue
     		  to get hungry while the user is logged out and leaves it alone.  Be careful; your pet could die while you aren't there!</p>
     		  <p>The pet performs actions such as pooping, getting ill, eating, going outside, and being loved.  These are either triggered automatically,
     		  	or by buttons!  When a pet poops, the poop is stored as an object in the poop array, which is all cleaned up if the user presses the
     		  toilet button.</p>
     		  <p>As mentioned earlier, the state of the pet is saved every minute as an autosave, and can be manually saved by the user by pressing
     		  the save button</p>

      		<h3>Assets</h3>
      		  <p>All of our images were hand drawn, including all icons, backgrounds, and character animations!  It was
      		  a lot of extra work to make our own images, but it makes the product feel all the more handmade.</p>
      		  <p>Unfortunately, we are not audio engineers.  All of the sounds in our project are rips of
      		  sounds from Pokemon Emerald for Gameboy Advanced, including all background music.  Oh, and one extra
      		  spooky tune from Pokemon Red/Blue...</p>
      		  <p>All code was, of course, written by us!  The only exception to this is the speech recognition code, which we heavily
      		  based off of other examples.</p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <p>In making our project, we utlized p5 speech recognition, Google Firebase as a database to store users and their corresponding pet, and Bootstrap to make our site look fabulous!</p>
        <p>The speech recognition was used as a way to make your pet feel more real; try saying "hi" or "hello" out loud to your pet!</p>
        <p>As for Firebase, we decided that it was one of the best ways, for our purposes, to store the properties of a user's pet and load them into the game. But of course, with loading a pet, means that one must save a pet. The game autosaves every minute
          when the pet's age updates, and if the user needs to log out before then, there's a handy save button right on the main menu that looks like a floppy disk.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>This little pet packs a hefty amount of features considering the time frame we had for this project!</p>
        <p>The pet, using the setInterval() function, has functions that automatically are called at specific time intervals to make the pet get hungry, sad, and sick in real time! The pet will also, when a user logs out and logs back in later, continue
          to get hungry while the user is logged out and leaves it alone. Be careful; your pet could die while you aren't there!</p>
        <p>The pet performs actions such as pooping, getting ill, eating, going outside, and being loved. These are either triggered automatically, or by buttons! When a pet poops, the poop is stored as an object in the poop array, which is all cleaned up
          if the user presses the toilet button.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, the state of the pet is saved every minute as an autosave, and can be manually saved by the user by pressing the save button</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Assets</h3>
        <p>All of our images were hand drawn, including all icons, backgrounds, and character animations! It was a lot of extra work to make our own images, but it makes the product feel all the more handmade.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we are not audio engineers. All of the sounds in our project are rips of sounds from Pokemon Emerald for Gameboy Advanced, including all background music. Oh, and one extra spooky tune from Pokemon Red/Blue...</p>
        <p>All code was, of course, written by us! The only exception to this is the speech recognition code, which we heavily based off of other examples.</p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center;">New Features</h1>
      <h3>AR Tracking</h3>
      <p>In the latest version of My Buddy, several new features have been implemented, including an unlock system of new food items
      via augmented reality.  This system uses fiducial marker tracking to detect if specific patterns are present, with these
      specific patterns being unlock keys for several different new food items!  Get 'em while food is free; in the next update,
      currency (paying for your pet's food) should be implemented!</p>
      <p>If you want these patterns, the files are available publicly on the <a href="https://github.com/rfree18/my-buddy">GitHub Page.</a>  Feel free to
      download them and scan them in from your phone!</p>
      <h3>Evolutions</h3>
      <p>Finally, there are some new characters that we can welcome to our lineup!  This update introduces two new evolutions
      from the base character, our favorite blue blob.  These characters can be attained after you raise your Buddy for one day, a year in their time,
      and will be picked depending on how well you cared for your Buddy!</p>
      <div class = "pic-container"><img src="./img/character_imgs/lightBulb/bulbFWD.png"><img src="./img/character_imgs/lightBulb/love2.png"><img src="./img/character_imgs/lightBulb/eat1.png"></div>
      <p>Our first character is a little lightbulb who's just looking to brighten someone's day.  You've gotta take really good care of your Buddy if you want to get a chance to get to raise 
      this character!</p>
      <div class="pic-container"><img src="./img/character_imgs/purpleEmo/purpleFWD.png"><img src="./img/character_imgs/purpleEmo/mad2.png"><img src="./img/character_imgs/purpleEmo/love2.png"></div>
      <p>Uh oh...if you neglect your first buddy, you could end up with this mischevious character!  They smile when they tell you no, and overall seem to always be causing drama and sulking
      around.  That is, except when they can get a bite to eat, or if they're feeling particularly affectionate with you.  It's not just a phase, mom!</p>
